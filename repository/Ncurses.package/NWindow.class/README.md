A Window is an imaginary screen defined by curses system. A window does not mean a bordered window which you usually see on Win9X platforms. When curses is initialized, it creates a default window named stdscr which represents your 80x25 (or the size of window in which you are running) screen. If you are doing simple tasks like printing few strings, reading input etc., you can safely use this single window for all of your purposes. You can also create windows and call functions which explicitly work on the specified window.
